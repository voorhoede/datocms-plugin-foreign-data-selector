# Foreign Data Selector

Content managed in DatoCMS is often related to foreign data in external databases or services, like products in an e-commerce platform. The DatoCMS Foreign Data Selector Plugin offers a generic solution to link to these external data sources, search for items and save a reference in a DatoCMS record. So for example your home page could have a highlighted products section.
